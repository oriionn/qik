# qik
A simple &amp; configurable template manager.

## Why choose qik?
You should choose Qik because Qik is simple. In fact, with our full docs available [here](https://qik-docs.oriondev.fr/) you can easily create `Qikfile` to offer your templates to Qik users. What's more, whatever the name of your template, the name will never be taken as we use git and the user to define aliases.

## Installation
```bash
npm install -g qik-cli
```
